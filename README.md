# Tutorial of Solar Flare Data Analysis
    
In this tutorial, I provide a walk-through of how to provide better data about the top 50 solar flares recorded so far than that shown by SpaceWeatherLive.com. 
First, I scrape data from SpaceWeatherLive.com and Wind/WAVES type II bursts and CMEs using BeautifulSoup. I save both 
sets of data as dataframes using Pandas. I then tidy this data by coding missing observations properly, recoding columns that correspond to more 
than one piece of information, and treating dates and times appropriately. Finally, I provide a data analysis comparing the solar flare data 
obtained from SpaceWeatherLive.com and NASA.
